# Student practices

Here are some general guidelines that you can follow:

README file: A README file is the first file that people see when they visit your repository, so it's important to make a good impression. It should include a brief description of your project, how to set it up, and how to run it.

License file: If you want to open source your project, it's important to include a license file. This will specify the terms under which others can use your code. Some popular open-source licenses include the MIT License, the GPL License, and the Apache License.

Source code: This is the main directory for your project's source code. It should include all the necessary files and directories for your project to run.

Documentation: If your project is complex or involves multiple components, it can be helpful to include documentation. This can include user guides, API references, and code comments.

Tests: Including a directory for tests is a best practice. This will allow you to ensure that your code is functioning as intended and that changes won't break existing functionality.

Assets: If your project requires any assets, such as images, audio files, or videos, they should be stored in a separate directory.

Releases: When you release a new version of your project, you should create a new release on GitHub. This allows users to download a specific version of your code.
